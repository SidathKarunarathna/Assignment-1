    <p class="second-para"><b>Cyber security can be described as the collective methods,
       technologies, and processes to help protect the confidentiality, integrity,
       and availability of computer systems, networks and data, against cyber-attacks
        or unauthorized access. The main purpose of cyber security is to protect all
        organizational assets from both external and internal threats as well as
         disruptions caused due to natural disasters.<br>As organizational assets are made
         up of multiple disparate systems, an effective and efficient cyber security
         posture requires coordinated efforts across all its information systems. Therefore,
         cyber security is made up of the following sub-domains</b></p>

          external or internal threats or attackers to exploit and compromise the
